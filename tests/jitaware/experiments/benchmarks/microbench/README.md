### Introduction

This readme is for running experiment on micro-benchmark for JITProf.

### A Quick Experiment

First download all files in this directory (i.e., the ```js``` folder and ```compare.html``` etc.)

Next open the ```compare.html``` file using the browser you would like to test (e.g., Firefox or Chrome).

The performance difference between the JIT-unfriendly code and JIT-friendly code will be calculated and shown in the web page opened.

### A Systematic Experiment

Go to the following link and see how to configure the experiment environment:

https://github.com/Berkeley-Correctness-Group/Jalangi-Berkeley/tree/master/tests/jitaware/experiments

After the experimental environment is setup, read the section "Run Browser Experiments on Micro-Benchmarks" inside the readme file under that fold.
